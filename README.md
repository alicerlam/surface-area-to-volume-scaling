# Overview
A collection of scripts that allows users to select one slice of interest of a fluorescent Z-stacked timelapse movie for each cell identified in the original image, before automatically calculating the radius of the cell, the background intensity inside and outside of the cell, and the maximum intensity/full-width-half-maximum intensity/area of the cell membrane.
